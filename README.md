This is a simple SwiftUI-based weather app that focuses on the user interface. It's designed to provide an aesthetically pleasing and responsive user experience for iOS devices.

## Features

- **User Interface:** The app showcases a clean and user-friendly interface using SwiftUI, offering a modern design that adapts to various iOS devices.

- **Sample Data:** The current version of the app uses sample data to simulate weather information. This is intended to give you a glimpse of the app's potential.

- **Future API Integration:** While this version uses static data, the project is designed to accommodate future integration with weather APIs for real-time weather information.
